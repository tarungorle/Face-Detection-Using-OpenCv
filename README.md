# Face Detection Using Opencv

Here I made use of Opencv and python libraries to detect the faces in a photo with greater and better accuracy

Opencv is a library which is mostly used in computer vision domain

-->First, algorithm will convert the imported picture into gray as noise in gray color is very much lower than RGB or coloured image, 

-->then after conversion it will detect the faces by use of xml file which consists of only facial data to detect. then it reverses the operation by converting into RGB

Use cases:

--> Simple Use case is Our Mobile camera whihc detects our face when we are before the camera
--> Facebook detects the faces in a rapid way which is used to tag people and a lot
--> Camscanner application
